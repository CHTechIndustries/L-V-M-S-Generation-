# Language, Voice, Musice, Sound Generation+
what does that mean, you ask?
well, im glad you did! this system is designed to do 4 primary tasks, optinally with the aid of ChatGPT
oh, what are those 4 primary things? right, here:
## Language
the goals are:
Analyze images of text to translate them. if not reconized, use more samples to eventually digure it out
translate text
be able to derive languages, even extrapolate what a probable written form of a language with no writing would be, if they had made one
## Voice
plans:
translate voices
synthesyze useing peoples voices
create syntheti  voices, and clone other peoples
extrapolate a verbal form of dead languages, or ones with no words (such as wistling based languages)
## Sound
plans:
similar thing, but generating and manipulating sound, as well as instruments
## Muisic
plans:
ability to generate text to speach music
ability to be used as a music synthesyzer (think voiceVox, reaper, ext.)
extrapalate music forms of things that we know where used as music, but only the words are know. use historical data to figure out the probable beat and such.
